Visualization of the stocks on heroku 

Alpha_vantage .... time series data.
 
When using regular python  - plotting with other (plotly, matplotlib) - figures look better.
Streamlit plots were not the best but work on heroku. 
I tested 'requests','json','plotly'. I chose 'interactive' options of streamlit.



# Streamlit on Heroku

This project ties together Streamlit, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The repository contains a basic template for a Streamlit configuration that will
work on Heroku.
